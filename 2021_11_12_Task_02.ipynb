    "## A Note on Grading\n",
    "The total number of points in this project is 100. We further provide the number of points achievable with each excercise. You should take particular care to document and visualize your results.\n",

    "\n",
    "The notebook you submit **should compile** (or should be self-contained and sufficiently commented). Check tutorial 1 on how to set up the Python3 environment.\n",

    "## Code of Honor\n",
    "We encourage discussing ideas and concepts with other students to help you learn and better understand the course content. However, the work you submit and present **must be original** and demonstrate your effort in solving the presented problems. **We will not tolerate** blatantly using existing solutions (such as from the internet), improper collaboration (e.g., sharing code or experimental data between groups) and plagiarism. If the honor code is not met, no points will be awarded.\n",
